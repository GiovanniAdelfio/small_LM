*** Small Language Model Trained on Daily_Dialog ***
\nThe project consists in creating a small LM, and training it on a subset of Dialy_Dialog to reduce the variety of the vocabulary the model has to learn, as done in Tiny Stories. 
Subsequently, we will reduce the model size using different techiques, in order to perform inference locally on very computationally limited devices.
